1. Convert the original `[dataset name].csv` to `[dataset name].geojson`. This can be accomplished through command line tools like OGR or through GUIs like QGIS. 
	- Ensure that all fields that you wish to visualize in Mapbox are numeric
	- Remove or replace all null values as those cannot be redefined in Mapbox styles. (eg, replace blanks or nulls with a value like -999 so that you can style them appropriately)
	- If using complicated shape files like CSD data, simplify in a mapping program to reduce file size.
	- Make sure you export to the projecttion EPSG:4326 rather than the default.


2. Create a tileset (`*.mbtiles`) either by using [tippecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe) for a more customized approach, or simply uploading the `[dataset name].geojson` in Mapbox Studio as Mapbox has created automatic script to convert the `[dataset name].geojson` to the desired `[dataset name].mbtiles`.
	- If tippecanoe is used, the following command can run to create the `[dataset name].mbtiles`: `tippecanoe -o [dataset name].mbtiles --base-zoom 0 --force [dataset name].geojson`

3. In Mapbox Studio, make sure your newly uploaded `[dataset name].mbtiles` is stored within the [tileset view](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/).

4. Next, go to the styles tab and copy (duplicate) an existing style. This assures that the same data layers and style properties are incorporated for the new dataset. If you are creating a new style, ensure that it is set up to be compatible with Mapbox GL 1.2, as this is the version used by the program.

5. Open the copied style in Mapbox Studio, you will then need to update the data sources to the new `[dataset name]` and `[dataset name]-labels` map layers.
	- Make sure the `[dataset name]` 
	- Make sure the `[dataset name]-labels` layer is set to symbol type.

6. Save the style, take note of the style URL and of the name of your dataset and label layers.
